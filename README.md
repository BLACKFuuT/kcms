# KCMS – Knowledge Content Management System

KCMS is a Django-based backend project built to practice real-world backend engineering concepts using **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
The project intentionally focuses on architecture, permissions, authentication, and API design rather than frontend styling.

This repository demonstrates how traditional Django (HTML views) and DRF APIs can coexist cleanly in the same codebase.
